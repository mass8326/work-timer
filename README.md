# Work Timer

A minimalist stopwatch that keeps track of the time you spend actively working on your projects.

- **Automatic Tracking** - the clock starts and stops depending on if your currently active program is on your whitelist
- **Idle Detection** - the clock stops when it detects no activity, preventing idle time from being tracked
- **Project Files** - track multiple projects independent of each other by saving your timer state to a file
- **Cross Platform** - available for Windows and Linux on x86-64 and ARM64
